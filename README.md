# SimLoss: Class Similarities in Cross Entropy

This repository contains the code for the paper "SimLoss: Class Similarities in Cross Entropy".
We conducted experiments for Age Estimation and Image Classification.
The code for these experiments can be found in the folders `age_estimation` and `image_classification`, respectively.
Each folder contains a `README.md` file, which describes how to run that specific experiment.

## Extended Version

We provide an extended version of this paper on Arxiv that has further insights into the proposed loss function.
